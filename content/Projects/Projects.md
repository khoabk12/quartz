## My Developer Journey: From Coffee to Chaos (and Back!)

This is the story of my wild ride as a developer!

**Escape from Coffee Land (April 2021)**

In April 2021, I left my job as an Android developer at a company called The Coffee House. It was time for a change! My first mission was a secret Android project called "Project E". Basically, I took over from someone who, well, let's just say they didn't leave on the best terms.

**Goodbye Android, Hello RPA! (May 2022)**

By May 2022, Project E was finished and just needed occasional maintenance (which basically means to work sometimes!). But I hate being bored! So, I joined the company's team that builds cool automation tools. They were using something called VBA in Excel along with Selenium to make these tools. I knew Selenium because I used it for fun projects before, so I jumped in and became part of the robot crew!

**Microsoft Office Takes Over (June 2022)**

June was crazy! An old co-worker came back as a client with two new projects, "Project C" and "Project J". Both projects involved all things Microsoft Office 365, including PowerApps and Power Automate. Apparently, those were the new ways to make things work better.

**More Microsoft Fun (August 2022)**

In August, another client (who also loved Microsoft!) needed a system for their team to submit requests (this was Project F with client O).

**Android Returns! (Late 2022)**

**Master of Many Projects (Thanks to a Lot of Coffee!)**

Just when I thought things couldn't get any wilder, late 2022 brought a new challenge: an Android app called Project I for client A. This app would be like a giant knowledge hub with video interviews and training sessions!

So, that's my story! I've gone from Android development to automation to conquering the Microsoft Office world. You can call me your friendly neighborhood "Android Developer Extraordinaire" (or maybe just "caffeinated coder").
