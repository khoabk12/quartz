In this blog post, we delve into the inspiring journey of ELSA Speak, an English learning application co-founded by Vu. This app has gained significant recognition, recently being featured as one of the standout applications on the App Store. The discussion highlights the challenges faced during its development, the importance of understanding user needs, and the strategies that led to its success.

## The Beginning of ELSA Speak

Vu, who has been involved with ELSA Speak since its inception, shared her experiences during a recent conversation. ELSA Speak was launched approximately nine years ago, and Vu's motivation stemmed from her personal struggles with learning English. Despite years of formal education, she found herself lacking confidence when using English in real-world situations, especially after moving abroad.

### Identifying the Need

Vu realized that her challenges were not unique; many others faced similar difficulties in learning English. The primary obstacles included a lack of opportunities to practice speaking and receiving constructive feedback. This realization sparked the idea for ELSA Speak, aiming to provide a solution that could help millions of learners worldwide.

## The Development Journey

### Initial Challenges

One of the first hurdles Vu encountered was determining whether the product idea truly addressed a significant market need. She emphasized the importance of validating the concept beyond her immediate circle, ensuring it could resonate with a broader audience. This led to the decision to build a product that could eventually cater to a global market rather than just focusing on Vietnam.

### Building the Team

In the early days, the ELSA team was small, consisting of Vu, a CTO with extensive experience in speech recognition technology, and an iOS developer. Vu took on multiple roles, including design, user research, and content development, leveraging her background in linguistics and education. This hands-on approach allowed them to launch the app quickly, despite its initial imperfections.

## Overcoming Obstacles

### Gaining User Trust

One of the significant challenges was establishing credibility in a market where users were accustomed to traditional learning methods, often requiring native speakers for effective learning. Vu and her team had to work hard to convince potential users that ELSA could provide valuable feedback and support, similar to what a human tutor would offer.

### Setting Realistic Expectations

Vu shared insights on managing user expectations. She advised that it is crucial to under-promise and over-deliver, especially in the early stages. By setting realistic goals for the app's capabilities, they could build trust and gradually enhance the product based on user feedback.

## Scaling the Product

As ELSA Speak grew, the team expanded to around 200 members, with a significant portion being engineers and AI scientists. This scaling was essential to keep up with the increasing demand and to continuously improve the app's features.

### Revenue Streams

ELSA Speak primarily generates revenue through subscriptions on the App Store. Vu explained that targeting the App Store was strategic, as users there tend to have higher spending power and are more willing to pay for quality educational tools. The app's subscription model ensures a steady income, allowing for ongoing development and improvement.

## Future Directions

Looking ahead, Vu envisions ELSA Speak evolving into a more personalized learning experience. The integration of AI will enable the app to offer tailored learning paths, focusing on specific skills such as negotiation or customer service in English. This shift aims to enhance user engagement and effectiveness in learning.

## Conclusion

The journey of ELSA Speak is a testament to the power of perseverance, innovation, and understanding user needs. Vu's story serves as an inspiration for aspiring developers and entrepreneurs, highlighting that with the right mindset and collaboration, it is possible to turn challenges into opportunities. Whether you are a developer or not, the key takeaway is to pursue your ideas passionately and be open to learning and adapting along the way.
