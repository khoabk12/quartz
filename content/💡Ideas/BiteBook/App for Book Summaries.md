|                                   | Extract text from a specific region  | ✅ Yes                   | Use `PDFTextStripperByArea` to define and extract text from a bounding box.                                                         |

### **Does PDFBox Support Extracting Text Along with Format?**

- **Partially Supported**:
    - PDFBox can extract basic text formatting like font size, font name, and positions using `PDFTextStripper` and `TextPosition`.
    - Advanced formatting (e.g., bold, italic) and semantic structures (e.g., paragraphs, headers) are **not directly supported** but can be inferred with custom logic.

---

### **How to Extract Text Along with Format?**

Here’s how you can extract text and basic formatting using `PDFBox`:

#### **Step 1: Use `PDFTextStripper`**

This extracts the text while preserving positions.

#### **Step 2: Override `writeString()`**

Override this method to capture text details like font, size, and position.

#### **Example Code:**

```kotlin
import org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDDocument
import org.apache.pdfbox.text.PDFTextStripper
import org.apache.pdfbox.text.TextPosition

class TextWithFormatExtractor : PDFTextStripper() {
    override fun writeString(text: String, textPositions: List<TextPosition>) {
        for (textPosition in textPositions) {
            println(
                "Text: ${textPosition.unicode}, " +
                "Font: ${textPosition.font.name}, " +
                "Font Size: ${textPosition.fontSizeInPt}, " +
                "X: ${textPosition.xDirAdj}, Y: ${textPosition.yDirAdj}"
            )
        }
    }
}

fun extractTextWithFormat(pdfPath: String) {
    val document = PDDocument.load(File(pdfPath))
    val stripper = TextWithFormatExtractor()
    stripper.setSortByPosition(true)
    stripper.getText(document)
    document.close()
}
```

### **Limitations**

1. **Complex Formatting**:
    
    - Bold/italic styles are not inherently stored in the text but depend on font characteristics (e.g., names or weights).
    - You may need to analyze font names like `Times-Bold` to detect bold styles.
2. **Semantic Structures**:
    
    - PDFs do not store paragraphs or headers as structured data; they are treated as a collection of text objects.

---

### **Next Steps**

1. **Enhance the extractor**:
    - Use custom logic to group text into paragraphs or detect headers based on font size and position.
2. **Use PDFBox Utilities**:
    - Combine `PDFTextStripper` with layout or graphics analysis for advanced formatting.
