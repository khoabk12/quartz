### TL;DR

Weâ€™ve redesigned our appâ€™s UI to move away from a Messenger-style chat to a Facebook-inspired post feed. Posts are now more readable and engaging, and comments open in a bottom sheet to keep everything on the same screen. Itâ€™s simpler, easier to use, and feels more natural. ðŸŽ‰

### What Changed?

We noticed that using a Messenger-like design for posts wasnâ€™t working well. It felt cluttered, like annoying ads, and wasnâ€™t enjoyable to use. So, we made a big shift:

- **New Design**: 
	- Posts now look like entries in a Facebook feedâ€”familiar and easy to follow.
- **Comment Section**: 
	- Instead of opening on a new screen, comments now appear in a bottom sheet. This keeps the post in view, making it easier to stay connected to the conversation.

### Why the Change?

1. **Clarity**: The new post style is cleaner and easier to read.
2. **Engagement**: The Facebook-inspired design is something users already know and enjoy.
3. **Context**: The bottom sheet for comments keeps everything in one place, so you donâ€™t lose your spot.
