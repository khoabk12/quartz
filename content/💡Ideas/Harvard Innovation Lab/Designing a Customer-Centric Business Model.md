6. **Defining Your Business Model (13:47 - 19:15)**
    
    - Businesses should identify if their offering is **a product, service, data, or software**.
    - Example: An AI-driven accounting automation startup analyzed pricing and sales channels.

7. **Framework for Business Model Innovation (22:16 - 27:22)**

9. **The Power of Community & Ecosystem in Business Models (1:02:23 - 1:04:53)**
    
    - Open-source software and strategic partnerships can accelerate growth.
